Consent Decree\r\nParticipated Conferences\r\n\r\n\r\nUniversity of Chicago Crime Lab\r\nSDSC (Strategic Decision Support Center)\r\nDuring my time at the University of Chicago I primarily worked on the SDSC Project - a collaborative smart policing initiative within the Chicago Police Departmentâ€™s Bureau of Operations. Initially, I performed crime and resource analyses for 3 CPD districts and provided advice and data insight for the District Commanders while assisted in different capacities for many other districts across the city. Thereafter, I worked as the analyst for the Area South Deputy Chief while simultaneously taking on the role of ATC (Area Technology Center) Analyst for the Area South Detectives (The ATC is essentially the Bureau of Detectivesâ€™ version of SDSC, though with vastly different tools, equipment, and procedures). Following crime focused work I would move to the CPD HQ to work on a number of traffic, personnel, and consent decree related projects.\r\nHere you see me (top left) delivering a briefing to senior CPD staffUChicago articles regarding the history and background of the project: [history | overview | funding1 | funding2].\r\nResearch paper drafted by several of my colleagues containing more specific information on the project: [research paper]\r\nThe Chicago Police Dept. special order on SDSC operations within law enforcement setting: [CPD directives]\r\nInternal evaluation and independent third party evaluation conducted by the RAND Corporation pertaining to the effectiveness and results of the project: [Crime Lab evaluation | RAND evaluation]\r\nSDSC was recognized by the Integrated Justice Information Systems (NJIS) Institute and received the 2021 Thomas J. Oâ€™Reilly Innovation Award at its 2021 National SYmposium: [award article]\r\nCity of Chicago Office of the Mayor: Violent Reduction Dashboard\r\nOne critical component of my work with the City of Chicago Office of the Mayor was the Regional Coordination Meeting where I was in charge of the South Side data. The goal of the meeting was to identify and tackle violent crimes and other related issues with a wide range of agencies and organizations, including UChicago Crime Lab (with myself as representative), UChicago Medicine, Chicago Police Dept, Chicago Mayorâ€™s Office, Chicago Dept of Street and Sanitation, Chicago Park District, Cook County Stateâ€™s Attorneyâ€™s Office, Chicago CRED, and a number of other public agencies and outreach/non-profits.\r\nThe bi-weekly meetings required myself and another analyst to manually produce a bi-weekly data/ stats packet to reflect the number of fatal shootings, non-fatal shootings, and non-shooting homicides. As time went on, we realized there should be a more efficient method of displaying and disseminating the crime analytics, thus the VR dashboard was born. The beta version received approval from the Chicago former Deputy Mayor of Public Safety Susan Lee and former US Secretary of Education Arne Duncan and our team continued to polish the dashboard. After about 6 months of work, the VR Dashboard was officially launched on the City of Chicagoâ€™s Website as the first ever public data dashboard of the city. As one of the two analysts who created the dashboard, I also produced monthly update/troubleshooting newsletters, designed the cover page and base map of the dashboard, and trained and presented the tool to a wide range of public agencies, outreach organizations, and other stakeholders.\r\n\r\nA couple screenshots of the dashboard, made in Tableau and Tableau PrepAs of May 27th, 2021, the VR Dashboard is officially open to the public:\r\nTo access the website: [Dashboard]\r\nTo access the data source: [Chicago Data Portal]\r\nFor details directly from the Office of the Mayor: [Mayorâ€™s Press Release] | [VR Dashboard Use of Terms Agreement]\r\nTo see what the media is saying about this innovative tool: [CBS] | [FOX] | [MSN] | [Smart Cities World] | [The Chicago Defender]\r\nChicago Police Dept. Consent Decree\r\nI had the opportunity of working on a series of projects under the Consent Decree, which is a federal mandate set forth by the US Department of Justice to reform law enforcement agencies. The consent decree had already been implemented in a number of police departments across the US, including the LAPD, Seattle PD, and NOPD, before arriving in Chicago in 2017. Much of the work is focused on building community-police relationship, improving resource/patrol efficiency, and examining personnel data on absences/furloughs among others.\r\nFor background information on Chicago Police Consent Decree: [Illinois Attorney General] | [CPD Independent Monitor Team] | [City of Chicago]\r\nTo view CPDâ€™s internal tracking of the consent decree progress: [Dashboard]\r\nParticipated Conferences\r\nI have also attended a number of law enforcement and analytics conferences, including the Tableau Conference 2019, the International Association of Chiefs of Police Conference 2019, the Crimefighters Conference 2018, and the American Society of Criminology Annual Meeting 2015.\r\nPosing with my lovely colleagues from UChicago and CPDMe at the Tableau 2019 Data Night Outâ€¦ after a comlimentary makeupIf youâ€™re interested in Tableau events and conferences please click here [Tableau]\r\nAt the Crimefighters Conference 2018, my team and I presented innovative data visualizations using Tableau dashboards and new approaches to smart policing in front of an audience from over 25 law enforcement agencies and a panel which included the former CPDâ€™s Chief of Technical Services and former LAPDâ€™s Deputy Chief of Detectives.\r\nA colleague presenting my analytical report to showcase the smart policing aspect of the SDSC\r\n\r\n\r\n",
