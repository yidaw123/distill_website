<b> <font size="+2"> Welcome to my website! </font> </b>

I currently work as a Statistician for [the Ontario Ministry of the Solicitor General](https://www.mcscs.jus.gov.on.ca/english/default.html)'s law enforcement branch - [the Ontario Provincial Police](https://www.opp.ca/). Previously, I worked as a Project Manager and an Embedded Research Analyst for [the University of Chicago Crime & Education Labs](https://urbanlabs.uchicago.edu/) consulting for the Chicago Police Department, the Chicago Mayor's Office, and a number of public agencies and outreach organizations on policy recommendations and data analytics. Prior to entering the public and academic sectors, I worked as a Senior Market Researcher for a market research firm in Toronto.
