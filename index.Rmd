<b> <font size="+2"> Welcome to my website! </font> </b>

I'm currently an Analytics Manager for [Circana](https://www.circana.com/) (formerly IRI and the NPD Group), one of the largest market research consulting firms in the world, overseeing a talented team of analysts to generate actionable insights for our global clients through forecasting, machine learning, and advanced analytics.  

Prior to entering the private sector, I worked as a Statistician for [the Ontario Ministry of the Solicitor General](https://www.ontario.ca/page/ministry-solicitor-general)'s law enforcement branch - [the Ontario Provincial Police](https://www.opp.ca/). Before that, I was a Project Manager and an Embedded Research Analyst at [the University of Chicago Crime & Education Labs](https://urbanlabs.uchicago.edu/) consulting for the Chicago Police Department, the Chicago Mayor's Office, and a number of public agencies and outreach organizations on data analytics, policy analysis, and change management.
