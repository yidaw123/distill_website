My name is __Yida Wang__, and welcome to my website. I enjoy a wide array of hobbies from BJJ to chess, and from video games to binging documentaries so I'll pretty much write anything and everything.

I am very passionate about social policies and, in particular, criminal justice related discussions. Feel free to reach out using any of the links above and thank you for visiting!
