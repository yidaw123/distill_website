# Circana (formerly IRI and NPD Group)
## Project and Product Management
In my current role as an Analytics Manager, I oversee our forecasting product - the Pricing and Promotion Simulator (for more information on what the tool can do please click [here](https://www.npd.com/products/price-and-promotion-optimization/)). In this capacity I test the product, ETLs, and new features (QC, debugging, and etc), manage all simulator related work (analyses, reports, trainings, and presentations/Q & A sessions for senior/executive level clients), and leading a team of analysts to generate invaluable and actionable insights.

My expertise in market research consulting spans across many business verticals, including tech, CPG, retail, media, and general merchandise. I'm experienced in generating insights through quantitative (big data, predictive analytics, and forecasting) and qualitative analyses (surveys, focus groups, and consumer behaviors). 

## Coding and Machine Learning
As someone who has always enjoyed the hands-on aspect of data science, I try to (whenever possible) dive into coding projects on my own. Some of the tools I fiddle around with in my day-to-day include: SAS, SQL, and Python.

I'm currently working to improve my Python skills and learning to deploy ML models within Databricks. I love learning but sometimes I get carried away and overestimate how productive I can be and enroll in way more [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/), [edX](https://www.edx.org/), and [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) courses than I can manage...

# Ontario Provincial Police
## Data Analysis
During my tenure at the OPP (Business Management Bureau), I primarily led the traffic portfolio focusing on roadway fatalities, injuries, collisions, and etc. I was also heavily involved in other data projects, including crime, personnel, and resource allocation. 

While most of my work is classified in nature, you can find many crime and justice related reports our unit has helped compile for Statistics Canada as [[raw data](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/type/data?subject_levels=35)] and as [[analyses](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/type/analysis?subject_levels=35)].

## Business Operations
In an effort to streamline the reporting process, I led the effort to automate existing Excel reports into PowerBI dashboards, drafted standardized SOPs, and created training videos and documentations.

OPP officers are often contracted out to smaller municipalities and townships. In this capacity, I managed the finance and personnel statistics model to determine the cost of OPP contracts based on a number of factors/variables.

I also oversaw 50% of the unit's procurement work, e.g. working with vendors (including SAS) to determine the most optimal product package needed, creating business cases, and managing vendor contracts.

# University of Chicago Crime Lab
## SDSC (Strategic Decision Support Center)
During my time at the University of Chicago I primarily worked on the SDSC Project - a collaborative smart policing initiative within the Chicago Police Department's Bureau of Operations. Initially, I performed crime and resource analyses for 3 CPD districts and provided advice and data insight for the District Commanders while assisted in different capacities for many other districts across the city. Thereafter, I worked as the analyst for the Area South Deputy Chief while simultaneously taking on the role of ATC (Area Technology Center) Analyst for the Area South Detectives (The ATC is essentially the Bureau of Detectives' version of SDSC, though with vastly different tools, equipment, and procedures). Following crime focused work I would move to the CPD HQ to work on a number of traffic, personnel, and consent decree related projects.

## City of Chicago: Violence Reduction Dashboard
One critical component of my work with the City of Chicago Office of the Mayor was the Regional Coordination Meeting where I was in charge of the South Side data. The goal of the meeting was to identify and tackle violent crimes and other related issues with a wide range of agencies and organizations, including UChicago Crime Lab (with myself as representative), UChicago Medicine, Chicago Police Dept, Chicago Mayor's Office, Chicago Dept of Street and Sanitation, Chicago Park District, Cook County State's Attorney's Office, Chicago CRED, and a number of other public agencies and outreach/non-profits. 

The bi-weekly meetings required myself and another analyst to manually produce a bi-weekly data/ stats packet to reflect the number of fatal shootings, non-fatal shootings, and non-shooting homicides. As time went on, we realized there should be a more efficient method of displaying and disseminating the crime analytics, thus the VR dashboard was born. After about 6 months of work, the VR Dashboard was officially launched on the City of Chicago's Website as the first ever public data dashboard owned by the city. As one of the two analysts who created the dashboard, I also produced monthly update/troubleshooting newsletters, designed the cover page and base map of the dashboard, and trained and presented the tool to a wide range of public agencies, outreach organizations, and other stakeholders.

As of May 27th, 2021, the VR Dashboard is officially open to the public:

## Chicago Police Dept. Consent Decree
I had the opportunity of working on a series of projects under the Consent Decree, which is a federal mandate set forth by the US Department of Justice to reform law enforcement agencies. The consent decree had already been implemented in a number of police departments across the US, including the LAPD, Seattle PD, and NOPD, before arriving in Chicago in 2017. Much of the work is focused on building community-police relationship, improving resource/patrol efficiency, and examining personnel data on absences/furloughs among others.

# Participated Conferences
I have also attended a number of law enforcement and analytics conferences, including the Tableau Conference 2019, the International Association of Chiefs of Police Conference 2019, the Crimefighters Conference 2018, and the American Society of Criminology Annual Meeting 2015.

At the Crimefighters Conference 2018, my team and I presented innovative data visualizations using Tableau dashboards and new approaches to smart policing in front of an audience from over 25 law enforcement agencies and a panel which included the former CPD's Chief of Technical Services and former LAPD's Deputy Chief of Detectives.
